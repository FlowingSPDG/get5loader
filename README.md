## About
This is match management system for [get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5).  
Inspired by [get5-web](https://github.com/splewis/get5-web).  


## How to use
1. Login by your SteamID.
2. Register your CS:GO servers on the "Add a server" section.
3. Register teams on the "Create a Team" section with steamids.
4. Go to the "Create a Match" page.

API Server will send rcon command to load match config( ``get5_loadmatch_url <webserver>/api/v1/match/<matchid>/config`` ) Then game server loads match and wait for players.
